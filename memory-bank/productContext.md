# Pantheon Framework - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The Pantheon Framework addresses the growing need for structured, maintainable AI-powered applications in the .NET ecosystem. As organizations increasingly integrate AI capabilities into their software, there's a demand for a framework that standardizes these integrations while providing flexibility and scalability.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Integration Complexity**: Simplifies the integration of various LLM providers into .NET applications
2. **Workflow Management**: Provides a structured approach to defining and executing complex AI workflows
3. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent patterns for AI interaction across applications
4. **Modularity Challenges**: Offers a clear separation of concerns for AI-related components
5. **Development Efficiency**: Reduces boilerplate code and common AI implementation patterns

## How It Should Work
1. The framework provides a set of interfaces and base implementations for key components:
   - Templates for LLM interaction
   - Flow definitions for orchestrating operations
   - Storage mechanisms for persisting flow state
   - Executors for handling the runtime execution
   - LLM clients for communicating with AI providers

2. Users implement and extend these components to build their specific applications
3. The framework handles the orchestration, execution tracking, and integration points

## User Experience Goals
1. **Developer Clarity**: Clear, intuitive interfaces that are easy to understand and implement
2. **Flexibility**: Support for various LLM providers and execution models
3. **Extensibility**: Easy extension points for custom functionality
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Performance**: Efficient execution of AI workflows without unnecessary overhead
6. **Testability**: Components designed to be easily testable in isolation
