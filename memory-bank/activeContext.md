# Pantheon Framework - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on improving the framework's handling of generic types in flow execution, particularly around JSON data handling in the API controllers.

## Recent Changes
1. **InputWrapper Implementation**: Added an InputWrapper class in FlowsController.cs to properly handle JSON input data that satisfies the 'class' constraint for SubmitFlowAsync.
2. **Fixed Generic Flow Execution**: Updated InMemoryExecutor to handle flow execution with generic context.
3. **Added GenericFlowAdapter**: Implemented GenericFlowAdapter to fix casting errors in the SimpleSkill sample.
4. **Repository Structure Setup**: Set up initial repository structure and added .gitignore for .NET projects.
5. **Memory Bank Creation**: Established the Memory Bank documentation structure to track project knowledge.
6. **Git Tracking Cleanup**: Removed bin and obj directories from Git tracking to ensure compiled files are not pushed to remote repositories, in compliance with .gitignore rules.

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Generic Type Support**: Ensure consistent handling of generic types across all components.
2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error handling and reporting in flow execution.
3. **Add More LLM Providers**: Implement additional LLM client providers beyond the mock implementation.
4. **Implement Additional Queue Types**: Develop other queue implementations (Redis, etc.) for flow management.
5. **Expand Test Coverage**: Increase unit and integration test coverage for core components.
6. **API Documentation**: Add comprehensive API documentation using standard .NET documentation tools.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in flow execution.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Generic Type Constraints**: Working through the implications of generic type constraints on flow execution and API controllers.
2. **Serialization Strategy**: Determining the best approach for serializing and deserializing flow state, especially with complex nested objects.
3. **Error Propagation**: Deciding how errors should be propagated and handled throughout the flow execution process.
4. **Queue Management**: Determining the best approach for flow queue management and handling expired flows.
5. **API Design**: Refining the API design to ensure it remains intuitive while supporting complex flow definitions.
6. **Extensibility Points**: Identifying key points where extensibility should be prioritized to support diverse use cases.
7. **Concurrency Control**: Managing concurrent flow execution through queuing and throttling mechanisms.
