# Pantheon Framework - Progress

## What Works
1. **Core Interfaces**: The foundational interfaces for the framework components are defined and functional.
2. **Flow Execution**: Basic flow execution via the InMemoryExecutor is working.
3. **Flow Queue**: Flow queue system for managing pending and in-progress flows is implemented.
4. **Template System**: Template definition and execution mechanics are implemented.
5. **API Controllers**: Basic API controllers for flow management are in place.
6. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for basic operations is functional.
7. **Mock LLM Client**: A mock implementation for testing purposes is available.
8. **In-Memory Storage**: Basic in-memory storage for flow state is operational.
9. **Sample Applications**: Simple examples demonstrating framework usage are available:
   - ChatApplication: Demonstrates a basic chat interface using the framework
   - SimpleSkill: Shows how to implement a simple skill using the framework

## What's Left to Build
1. **Additional LLM Providers**: Implementations for major LLM services beyond the mock client.
2. **Advanced Flow Control**: More sophisticated flow control mechanisms (branching, looping, etc.).
3. **Distributed Queue Implementations**: Develop Redis or other distributed queue implementations for flow management.
4. **Persistent Storage**: Implementations for durable storage options beyond in-memory.
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
6. **Observability Features**: Improved logging, metrics, and monitoring capabilities.
7. **Authentication & Authorization**: Security features for the API layer.
8. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples.
9. **Advanced Samples**: More complex sample applications demonstrating advanced usage patterns.

## Current Status
The framework is in an early developmental stage with the core components functional but requiring refinement. Recent work has focused on implementing the flow queue system and improving flow execution.

Key areas currently being addressed:
- Flow queue implementation and management
- Generic type constraints in flow execution
- JSON serialization/deserialization in API controllers
- Flow state handling and persistence
- Concurrent flow execution through the queued executor

## Known Issues
1. **Generic Type Constraints**: Some components have inconsistent handling of generic type constraints.
2. **Error Reporting**: Error reporting could be more detailed and user-friendly.
3. **Input Validation**: More robust input validation is needed in several components.
4. **Documentation**: Documentation is incomplete, particularly for advanced usage scenarios.
5. **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration test coverage needs expansion.
6. **Performance**: Some flow execution paths may have performance bottlenecks that need optimization.
